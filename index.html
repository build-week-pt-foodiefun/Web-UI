          <p>Tell me when you’ve heard this one. You remember a couple Thai Restaurants you’ve been to before but you
            can’t remember which one is the one with the good massaman or which has the better pad thai? What about the
            Mexican restaurant that has a wait time that will put gray in your hair? Or the Burger place that has the
            disgusting prices? The Pizza place with the divine cheese sticks?</p>
